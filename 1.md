## Jobs  

Jobs - Run in parallel through the job system. To spawn a single job that runs parallel to other jobs that are already running implement IJob.

Note: When designing your job, remember that they operate on **copies** of data, except in the case of NativeContainer. So, the only way to access data from a job in the main thread is by writing to a NativeContainer(such as NativeArray). 

### Native Containers  

    NativeList - a resizable NativeArray.
    NativeHashMap - key and value pairs.
    NativeMultiHashMap - multiple values per key.
    NativeQueue - a first in, first out (FIFO) queue.

    Due to the lack of ref returns, it is not possible to directly change the content of a NativeContainer. For example, nativeArray[0]++; is the same as writing var temp = nativeArray[0]; temp++; which does not update the value in nativeArray.

    Instead, you must copy the data from the index into a local temporary copy, modify that copy, and save it back, like so: 

* > MyStruct temp = myNativeArray[i];  
temp.memberVariable = 0;  
myNativeArray[i] = temp;

To run the job you must call .Schedule() on it. (Think lazy evaluation).
 > // Create a native array of a single float to store the result. This example waits for the job to complete for illustration purposes  
> NativeArray<float> result = new NativeArray<float>(1, Allocator.TempJob);

> // Set up the job data  
> MyJob jobData = new MyJob();  
> jobData.a = 10;  
> jobData.b = 10;  
> jobData.result = result;  

> // Schedule the job  
> JobHandle handle = jobData.Schedule();  

> // Wait for the job to complete  
> handle.Complete();  

> // All copies of the NativeArray point to the same memory, you can access the result in "your" copy of the NativeArray  
> float aPlusB = result[0];  

> // Free the memory allocated by the result array  
> result.Dispose();  

When you call the **.Schedule()** method on a job it returns a JobHandle. You can use a JobHandle in your code as a dependency
for other jobs. If a job depends on the results of another job, you can pass the first job’s JobHandle as a parameter to the second job’s Schedule method, like so:  
> JobHandle firstJobHandle = firstJob.Schedule();  
> secondJob.Schedule(firstJobHandle);   

JobHandle - A class that contains all of the associated data of the job that has finished/is being run. Use it to see if the job has completed (**.Completed()**)  

To force a job(s) to run immediately call **.ScheduleBatchedJobs()** on the jobhandle.  

Call Schedule on a job as soon as you have the data it needs, and don’t call Complete on it until you need the results. It is good practice to schedule a job that you do not need to wait for when it is not competing with any other jobs that are running. For example, if you have a period between the end of one frame and the beginning of the next frame where no jobs are running, and a one frame latency is acceptable, you can schedule the job towards the end of a frame and use its results in the following frame. Alternatively, if your game is saturating that changeover period with other jobs, and there is a big under-utilized period somewhere else in the frame, it is more efficient to schedule your job there instead.
